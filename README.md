### **Description:**

This Chrome extension is designed to streamline the way students access their university schedules from MyTimetable, a widely used platform affiliated with universities across the Netherlands. By providing a simple, user-friendly interface directly within the browser, students can easily view their upcoming classes and events without navigating through multiple tabs or apps.

### **Features:**

1. **Seamless Integration:** Connects directly to your MyTimetable account using the iCalendar URL provided by the platform.

2. **Real-time Updates:** Automatically syncs with your MyTimetable schedule to ensure you have the most up-to-date information at your fingertips.

3. **Offline Access:** Unlike many other similar tools, this extension allows you to access your schedule even when offline, ensuring you're never caught off guard by a sudden loss of internet connection. 

4. **Node.js Server:** Built on Node.js, ensuring a robust and scalable backend to handle data parsing and delivery efficiently.

5. **iCal to JSON Conversion:** Parses iCalendar data received from MyTimetable into JSON format, making it easier to manipulate and display on the client side.

6. **Cross-Platform Support:** Works seamlessly across different devices and operating systems, ensuring access to your schedule wherever you are.

### **How it Works:**

This extension utilizes a Node.js server to parse the iCalendar data provided by MyTimetable into JSON format. The JSON data is then sent to the client side where it is rendered in the extension's UI, allowing users to view their schedule at a glance.
